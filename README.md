# Glassmorphism web components Demo

## The scope
I wanted to touch on web components. I was inspired by the numerous glassmorphism UIs I've seen on dev.two, so I gave it a go.

I used a very colorful background to highlight the glassy properties of the cards.

## Preview
See it hosted on vercel: [Glass Web Components Demo](https://glass-web-components-demo.vercel.app/)

## The files

Web components
-  `glass-button.js` - provides 3 different styles of glass buttons
-  `glass-card.js` - receives a name, image, email, and phone, then creating a card with those details. It also imports the glass-button web component

Files for demo
-  `index.html` - simple html file that imports the glass-card web component. It contains a div that gets dynamically populated with content
-  `app.js` - dynamically generate user cards with the glass-card web component, using data generated by randomuser.me (10 results).
-  `style.css` - some styling for the index page
